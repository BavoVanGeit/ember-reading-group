# Week 2: Jump In!

## Introduction

### Notes

Read the assigned Ember Guides. Not going to reiterate  most of that here.

#### Possibly Surprising Things

File names are hyphenated.

Routes tell the template what model to display.

Controllers store state. Template retrieve properties from controllers which decorate models.

### Activity

This week we're just going to build an Ember application. The goal is to learn enough to be dangerous. In later weeks, we'll go more in depth. This week is just to see how we can build something.

We'll be running through the creation of the start of an interface for a blog.

Dives into some concepts of Ember and its differences from Rails. We'll get into the Ember intricacies in later weeks so don't worry if it doesn't all make sense.

## Bonus Point Assignments

:book: https://www.airpair.com/javascript/emberjs-using-ember-cli

A step-by-step guide to setting up an app with Ember CLI much like our activity for this week. Doesn't use Ember Data but includes some additional details.

Notes regarding the Airpair posts:
- To hide the obnoxious "Like learning from posts like this? Subscribe for more!" messages, I highly recommend putting "javascript:$('pre footer').hide()" in your location bar.
- The comments are actually worth reading for the most part.
