Set Up
======

# Install node (comes with npm)
http://nodejs.org/

# Install Ember CLI

http://www.ember-cli.com/
You can jump in and get your feet wet with the Starter Kit from emberjs.com
easily, but CLI is where Ember's headed and provides a robust setup for
developing a Real Application. It will be standard in Ember 2.0
(https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/15).

```
npm install -g ember-cli
npm install -g bower
npm install -g phantomjs
```

# Creating a New App
```
ember new my-new-app
cd my-new-app
ember server
```

# SASS support
`npm install --save-dev broccoli-sass`

# CoffeeScript support
`npm install --save-dev ember-cli-coffeescript`

Note that you will have to escape `import` and `export` lines in your .coffee
files with beginning and ending ticks, e.g. `\`import Ember from 'ember';\``

Things to Know About that Ember CLI Uses
========================================
broccoli - https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli
Build tool; "A fast, reliable asset pipeline, supporting constant-time rebuilds and compact build definitions. Comparable to the Rails asset pipeline in scope, though it runs on Node and is backend-agnostic"
Configured via Brocfile.js in top level of CLI generated app

bower - http://bower.io/
"A package manager for the web"

JavaScript modules - http://jsmodules.io/
Ember CLI uses the ES6 Module Transpiler (https://github.com/esnext/es6-module-transpiler) to support ES6 module syntax.

Handlebars - http://handlebarsjs.com/
Template language. Files use the `hbs` extension.
