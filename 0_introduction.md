Introduction
============
So we're going to approach this class in preparation for building real production applications in an Ember 2.0 environment. This means that there will be an increased learning curve, and you'll be exposed to more aspects of the ecosystem than just Ember core.

You can jump in and get your feet wet with the Starter Kit from emberjs.com
easily, but CLI is where Ember's headed and provides a robust setup for
developing a Real Application. It will be standard in Ember 2.0
(https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/15). It does, however, mean you need to become acquainted with more things.

If you see a :rowboat:, it means there's something that you should read or watch. I'll provide them inline with relevant notes when applicable, and I'll include a list at the bottom of each week's notes.
